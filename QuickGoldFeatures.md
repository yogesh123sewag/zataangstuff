~~Please leave your suggestions for features you want to see in future versions of QuickGold.~~

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: Please list needed features in the Issues table as well instead of leaving a comment here. Please try to keep it one feature-per issue filed. It is getting a bit difficult for me to sort things out from the comments :) I will read the issues and just attach labels appropriately to them. Thanks!

### Features planned ###

This is based both on my thoughts as well as your feedback.

  * ~~search safari bookmarks~~
  * ~~search safari history~~
  * ~~search contacts using phone numbers or emails~~
  * ~~send SMS or emails to contacts directly from QuickGold~~
  * ~~"g~~

&lt;keywords&gt;

" takes you to google search, similarly for maps, IMDB and Powerset~~* allow access to recently used items
  * settings so people can restrict / include what things they want to search for~~

#### Features I am worried about, and not likely to implement soon ####

Mainly, because I want QuickGold to be fast.

  * Searching music
  * Searching video

In general, I think the purpose of QuickGold is to speed-up things that need to be done very very often. For example, app launching, calling people, searching Google, etc. are some of the things almost all people do way too many times on the phone.

How often do people search for SMSes? or Notes? Or music? I think not very often. But I may be wrong. So, if you have particular use-cases for these as well, let me know.
