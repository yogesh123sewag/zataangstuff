## Introduction ##

QuickGold is a fast, keyboard-based launcher for pwned iPhones. Think Quicksilver for the iPhone.

## News ##

**IMPORTANT**

---

When you select a contact to call, Quickgold locks up on 2.2.

If this happens, please ssh into your device and issue the command 'killall
SpringBoard' ...

I am working on getting a fix ready now.

  * 1.2.2 is out now. It has less adverts. They will not show up all the time. Only some times. Hope you like it.
  * **1.2.1 is out now. 1.2 users should immediately upgrade since it fixes a dangerous crash related to indexing of contacts.**
  * Advertisements: I have received all kinds of responses: (1) I don't mind at all, they are done nicely, (2) please provide a pay-for-no-ads option (3) I hate you, go to hell. :)

> I am working on getting (2) working.
  * I have made two google groups: [quickgold](http://groups.google.com/group/quickgold) and [quickgold-beta-testers](http://groups.google.com/group/quickgold-beta-testers). Please join them as appropriate so the discussion is better structured. Also, the more people in beta testers, the merrier :)

## Features ##

Press the home (menu) button while you are on the SpringBoard to bring up a search bar and a keyboard. Type a few characters and tap to:

  * launch springboard apps (and webclips)
  * search contacts and dial their numbers with a tap
  * type in a phone number in the search box and hit "Go" to call
  * type in something like "yahoo.com" and hit "Go" to visit the page
  * type "g 

&lt;words&gt;

" and search google

~~For features you want, please leave a comment on the QuickGoldFeatures page.~~

Please also list features in the Issues table. Please try to keep it one feature-per issue filed. It gets pretty difficult for me to sort things out from the comments! I will read the issues and just attach labels appropriately to them. Thanks!

## Advertisements ##

I have added ads to support myself. I have made my utmost effort to keep them really unobtrusive. In fact, as soon as you typing anything, both the ads and the keyboard switcher buttons disappear. So it does not use any **real** screen-estate at all. This allows you guys to use this for free, while I spend my time improving QuickGold and trying to make it one indispensable program.

After you press the home button, and type in a few characters, while on the springboard:
